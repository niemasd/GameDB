# GameDB
Niema's databases for games from various consoles. These repositories are not intended to serve as a replacement for websites like [TheGamesDB](https://thegamesdb.net/) or [PlayStation DataCenter](https://psxdatacenter.com/), but rather, these repositories are intended to serve as a more structured format of metadata (e.g. for use in tools, devices, etc.) that can be easily downloaded in bulk.
