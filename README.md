# GameDB
Niema's databases for games from various consoles. These repositories are not intended to serve as a replacement for websites like [TheGamesDB](https://thegamesdb.net/), [Micro-64](http://micro-64.com/database/masterlist.shtml), [PlayStation DataCenter](https://psxdatacenter.com/), etc., but rather, these repositories are intended to serve as a more structured format of metadata (e.g. for use in tools, devices, etc.) that can be easily downloaded in bulk.
