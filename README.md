# GameDB

Niema's databases for games from various consoles. These repositories are not intended to serve as a replacement for websites like [TheGamesDB](https://thegamesdb.net/), [Micro-64](http://micro-64.com/database/masterlist.shtml), [PlayStation DataCenter](https://psxdatacenter.com/), etc., but rather, these repositories are intended to serve as a more structured format of metadata (e.g. for use in tools, devices, etc.) that can be easily downloaded in bulk. You can also interact with GameDB via the following interactive web page:

Are you interested in using GameDB in your projects? Please feel free to do so! Each GameDB repository has structured downloads (e.g. JSON and TSV) with URLs that always point to the most recent contents of the database, and they were designed this way to make it easy to load into other projects. All we ask is that you provide attribution to GameDB as well as to any other sources from which GameDB pulled information (see the "Sources" section in each individual GameDB repository).
